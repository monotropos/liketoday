# LikeToday

## Description

Show posts (titles and URLs) from WordPress blogs posted some years ago on today's date.

The plugin does not collect any personal data, so it is **ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance**.

### Lightweight, simple and effective

No huge widget with hundreds of options, just one.

### Options you can set

1. Title of the widget

### Languages

Just English for the time being.
Admins can define widget's title to whatever they like (every supported language) through the Widgets setup screen, as seen in assets/screenshot-1.png
